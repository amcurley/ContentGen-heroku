South America is made for travelers looking to delve deep into incredibly diverse cultures and explore the outdoors. The biggest draws to the continent are the Galápagos Islands, Iguazu Falls, Machu Picchu and, of course, Patagonia.

But, the city life all over the continent is also one of a kind! In Argentina, you can find foodie culture throughout Buenos Aires, and the Mendoza wine region. Explore the Atacama Desert in Chile, the Uyuni Salt Flats in Bolivia, and trek the Inca Trail in Peru.

Be sure to hit the beaches of Rio before you leave. In recent years, Colombia has been an up-and-coming travel destination. There’s always something exciting and new to try in South America.

If you’re traveling alone, hostels are the cheapest place to stay in Argentina, especially in built-up areas. However, if you’re not looking for luxury there are many cheap double rooms available in Buenos Aires, often with shared bathrooms.

If you’re traveling to Patagonia on a budget I’d recommend camping. Camping in Argentina is very cheap or sometimes even free. Campsites are plentiful around the hiking hotspot regions of Bariloche and El Chalten. Here are some of my favorite budget places to stay:

Buenos Aires
Malevo Muraña Hostel: Located in cool Palermo, this hostel is colorful, kitsch and has a lovely patio and communal area. Large baskets are provided for keeping all your stuff in one place. Dorms and privates are available.

Art Factory San Telmo: A lively, hip hostel in the heart of San Telmo, this place is great for that hostel vibe without having to stay in a dorm- their private rooms are very affordable.

Bariloche
Hostel Tierra Gaucha: This alpine-esque wooden cottage is the perfect place to stay when on a budget. A double room is extremely affordable and it’s located in the center of town. They even have a classic video game machine to keep you busy on rainy days!
