Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language

Classic philosophical questions include, "Is it possible to know anything?", and if so, "Can we prove it?"

However, more practical and concrete questions may be posed, such as: "Is there a best way to live?", "Is it better to be just, even if one could get away with being unjust?", and "Do humans have free will?"
