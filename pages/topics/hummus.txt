Hummus ()'chickpeas in tahini') is a dip, spread, or savory dish made from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon juice, and garlic.[3] It is popular in the Middle East and in Middle Eastern cuisine around the globe. It can also be found in most grocery stores in North America and Europe.

Hummus is a classic Middle Eastern dip that's enjoying renewed popularity. If you'd like to make your own, decide if you have time to soak and boil dried chickpeas. To make the hummus from scratch, blend your soaked chickpeas with garlic, tahini, and seasonings. For a quicker version, drain canned chickpeas and blend them with the garlic, tahini, and lemon juice. Drizzle your hummus with olive oil and serve it with pita or raw vegetables.
