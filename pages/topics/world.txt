The world is the Earth and all life on it, including human civilisation. In a philosophical context, the "world" is the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world (the "world" of an individual). In a theological context, the world is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres.

 In terms such as world religion, world language, world government, and world war, the term world suggests an international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of every part of the world.

In his Allegory of the cave, Plato distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world
